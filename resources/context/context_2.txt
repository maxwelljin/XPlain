So a concrete example that shows you a difference between group homomorphisms and
Freiman homomorphisms is, suppose you take an arbitrary map phi from a set that has no
additive structure. So it's a four-element set, has no additive structure. And I map it to the
integers, claim that this is a Freiman 2-homomorphism. So you can check. So whenever this is
satisfied, but that's never non-trivially satisfied. So an arbitrary map here is a Freiman 2-
homomorphism.
And if furthermore-- so if you have, let's say, bijection between two sets, both having no
additive structure, if it's a bijection, it's a Freiman isomorphism of here, order 2. Let me give
you a few more examples. When you look at homomorphisms between finite groups, so you
know that if you have a homomorphism and it's also a bijection, then it's an isomorphism.
But that's not true for this notion of homomorphisms. So the natural embedding that sends the
Boolean cube to the Boolean cube viewed as Z mod 2 to the n. So what's happening here?
This is a part of a group homomorphism. And so if you look at Z to the n, and I do mod 2, and
I restrict to this Boolean cube, that's the group homomorphism If I view this as a subset of a
bigger group.
So it is a Freiman homomorphisms of every order. And it's bijective. But it is not a Freiman 2-
isomorphism. Because you have additive relations here that are not present over here. So if
you read the definition, the inverse map, there are some additive relations here that are not
preserved if you pull back.
